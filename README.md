# TraudeZ99-3

A leveraged trading bot built in TypeScript/Node.js, progressing from basic margin trading to advanced quantitative and algorithmic strategies.

## Overview

This project implements a modular trading bot that supports multiple leveraging techniques across forex, crypto, and stock markets. The bot is designed with a phased development approach, starting with foundational infrastructure and risk management, then layering in progressively more sophisticated strategies.

### Core Capabilities (Planned)

- **Multi-exchange connectivity** — REST and WebSocket integration for real-time trading
- **Strategy engine** — Pluggable strategies including trend following, momentum, scalping, mean reversion, and breakout trading
- **Risk management** — Stop-losses, position sizing, drawdown protection, and leverage controls
- **Backtesting** — Historical data replay with realistic slippage and fee modeling
- **Pyramiding & scaling** — Add to winners with risk-managed position building
- **Quantitative analysis** — ML-based signals, adaptive parameters, and sentiment analysis
- **Derivatives & hedging** — Options strategies, ratio-backspreads, and hedging with futures/swaps
- **Algorithmic execution** — Low-latency order routing, TWAP/VWAP, and smart order routing
